# PerishAlert System

It is a basic project based on fruit/vegetable freshness detection based on readings and observations.
This project is made to learn the basics and working of arduino uno and its interface with some different sensors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is mainly based on MQ-4 METHANE GAS SENSOR.
Connections and code are given in repository.

One should use a vaccum tight container so that no gas passes away and can be read by sensor. (USE FOR ACCURATE READINGS)

Readings along with the timestamps (4-5 days) of a fruit which i had taken for experiment is also given.
          (remember the readings are of fruit in GOOD condition to BAD condition)
